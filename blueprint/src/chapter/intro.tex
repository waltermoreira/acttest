\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This library contains the formalization of a collection of facts about sequences from 
the \href{https://oeis.org}{On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences} (OEIS)~\cite{oeis}.

The sequences are hyper-linked to the OEIS in the 
\href{https://provables.github.io/docs/Sequencelib/Basic.html}{docs}.

Chapters in the blueprint provide informal mathematical content meaningful to the
formalization.
